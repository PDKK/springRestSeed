# Spring Rest Seed

This repo is a starter for Spring Rest with JPA, using an Angular front end.

The Spring tutorials use h2 as the back end, but this uses MySQL/MariaDB, which resulted in a bit of ugliness (now resolved in application.properties)

## Status
- Connects to the database, but Rest endpoints are untested
- Angular part only connects to an internal rest interface - it is still the simple Spring angular demo
